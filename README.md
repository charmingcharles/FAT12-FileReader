# FAT12-FileReader
This program allows us to read files from FAT12 disk image. 

## Additional files
To make running my program as easy as it can get I added disk image [count_fat12_volume.img](count_fat12_volume.img) It is not my file. It is in posession of [my university](https://p.lodz.pl/). 

## Usage
I named my functions so that it can be understood what is their use. To read an image from disk all you need to do is follow the same steps as the [main function](main.c).
